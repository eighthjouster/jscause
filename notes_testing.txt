List of sanity checks:
======================

Why are we using '!!' in places that are obviously boolean?

===

What happens if opening the log file fails?
  - Or if the writing fails?
    - If you can't write tests for this, at least simulate it just to make sure that the log queue doesn't grow indiscriminately because the writing process got stalled.
      - If it grows, here's a chance to put a failsafe of the sort:
         - "Queue more than 10000 lines long? Don't add more lines and emit a console warning."

At this point, back up.

Test: What if a port is taken? (By some other application.)

Go through the code and see what else needs to be tested that is not directly related to serving files.
 - Reading user files.
   - Static/dynamic.
     - May need jscCallback/jscThen/jscCatch
 - Caching user files.
   - Static/dynamic.
     - May need jscCallback/jscThen/jscCatch
 - Test webServer.jscContext
 - What else?

At this point, back up and....
PUBLISH AND ALPHA!

Then, go through the code and start testing content-related stuff:
  - Whether HTML stuff renders.
  - Forms / GET / POST.
     - Use big files just to make sure that processes don't go past the next test.
     - May need jscCallback/jscThen/jscCatch
  - JSON stuff.
  - File uploads.
    - Temporary upload files should be deleted.
     - May need jscCallback/jscThen/jscCatch
     - Use big files just to make sure that processes don't go past the next test.
  - Limits exceeded.  Timeouts.
     - May need jscCallback/jscThen/jscCatch
  - Callbacks.
     - May need jscCallback/jscThen/jscCatch
  - waitFor().
     - May need jscCallback/jscThen/jscCatch
  - rtThen() / rtCatch().
     - May need jscCallback/jscThen/jscCatch
  - Other rt's.
  - File operations.
     - May need jscCallback/jscThen/jscCatch
  - Redirects.
  - Cookies.
  - Error 400 / Error 500.
    - Static error 400, static error 500.
    - Other errors.
  +- Logging.
     *- Especially the file name auto-generation.
     *- May need jscCallback/jscThen/jscCatch
      +- Delete the log file and attempt to file log.  It should issue a warning.
        - Do this just with the server logging part.
        - Do this by putting a website with a setTimeout that logs before and after the timeout.
          - The first log is fine, the second log should happen when the file has been deleted (maybe half way through the timeout wait.)

      - Lock the log file (644) and attempt to file log.  It should issue a warning.
        - Do this just with the server logging part.
          - The first log is fine, the second log should happen when the file has been deleted (maybe half way through the timeout wait.)

  - At this point, resume engine development.
  - Publish another alpha.

Check all the output when running all the tests, in case there are inconsistencies (e.g., test says no console output, but console output ocurred.  Things like that.)

In the end, jscause_backup.conf can be either restored or deleted.


Do we ever use doRemoveDirectoryFromPathList()?
 - If not, consider removing it.  Or document its existence somehow.  I dunno...

- Leave this file to document future development that needs corresponding testings created.
