List of sanity checks:
======================

Paste this in a browser's console for a thrifty/nifty new line encoding/decoding tool:
document.body.innerHTML='<textarea onkeyup="document.body.children[1].innerHTML=event.target.value.replace(/\\n/g,\'\\\\n\')"></textarea><textarea onkeyup="document.body.children[2].innerHTML=event.target.value.replace(/\\\\n/g,\'\\n\')"></textarea><textarea></textarea>';


You should probably test server's enabled/disabled and site's per site combinations as well.

Test when the workbench directory does not exist.

mysite's localLogs was tested with absolute paths (which should prevent the server from starting.)  What other directories should be tested?
mysite config:  what if localLogs is not writeable? Or what if it's a symlink?
Test: When a mandatory value is missing from site.json (one by one.)
 - Especially the logging section.
 - So, remember that some keys are not mandatory (like the https cert ones.)
Test the multi-site combinations (when the server stops because two sites share the same name, etc.)
Test the configuration validity of tempWorkDirectory, if you haven't done so yet.
Test: What if a port is taken? (By some other application.)
Test: Check if a rootDirectoryName value is invalid.
 - As in, it must be a string, not a number.
    - What about other sibling values? "name", for example, can be an integer.  It should complain instead.
Test that https cert/key files are valid.
 - This will throw a critical, "unexpected" application error.  Work around this.

- When logging, check that the server configuration prevails if there are discrepancies.

- Test that console does not emit anything if disabled?

In the end, jscause_backup.conf can be either restored or deleted.
 - And rename __logs and __sites back to logs/ and sites/
