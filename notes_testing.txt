List of sanity checks:

Paste this in a browser's console for a thrifty/nifty new line encoding/decoding tool:
document.body.innerHTML='<textarea onkeyup="document.body.children[1].innerHTML=event.target.value.replace(/\\n/g,\'\\\\n\')"></textarea><textarea onkeyup="document.body.children[2].innerHTML=event.target.value.replace(/\\\\n/g,\'\\n\')"></textarea><textarea></textarea>';

Pending:

Test when the workbench directory does not exist.

mysite's localLogs was tested with absolute paths (which should prevent the server from starting.)  What other directories should be tested.
mysite config:  what if localLogs is not writeable? Or what if it's a symlink?
Test: When a mandatory value is missing from site.json (one by one.)
 - Especially the logging section.
 - So, remember that some keys are not mandatory (like the https cert ones.)
Test the multi-site combinations (when the server stops because two sites share the same name, etc.)
Test the configuration validity of tempWorkDirectory, if you haven't done so yet.
Test: What if a port is taken? (By some other application.)
Test: Check if a rootDirectoryName value is invalid.
 - As in, it must be a string, not a number.
    - What about other sibling values? "name", for example, can be an integer.  It should complain instead.
Test that https cert/key files are valid.
