List of sanity checks:
======================

Paste this in a browser's console for a thrifty/nifty new line encoding/decoding tool:
document.body.innerHTML='<textarea onkeyup="document.body.children[1].innerHTML=event.target.value.replace(/\\n/g,\'\\\\n\')"></textarea><textarea onkeyup="document.body.children[2].innerHTML=event.target.value.replace(/\\\\n/g,\'\\n\')"></textarea><textarea></textarea>';

Continue refactoring testBattery_006 so that it uses the make() functions.
 - And why don't you refactor the rest?  Global-search for "make base" and the modules that don't appear in the results... those need refactoring.
 
Test that https cert/key files are valid.
 - Test that valid servers (e.g. "INFO: Server 1 listening on port 3002") continue to run in spite of that one server having failed.

- Test that console does not emit anything if disabled?

Test: What if a port is taken? (By some other application.)

Go through the code and see what else needs to be tested that is not directly related to serving files.

Then, go through the code and start testing content-related stuff:
  - Whether HTML stuff renders.
  - Forms / GET / POST.
  - JSON stuff.
  - File uploads.
    - Temporary upload files should be deleted.
  - Limits exceeded.  Timeouts.
  - Callbacks.
  - waitFor().
  - rtThen() / rtCatch().
  - Other rt's.
  - File operations.
  - Redirects.
  - Cookies.
  - Error 400 / Error 500.
    - Static error 400, static error 500.
    - Other errors.
  - Logging.
  - What else?

In the end, jscause_backup.conf can be either restored or deleted.
 - And rename __logs and __sites back to logs/ and sites/
