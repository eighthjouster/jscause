List of sanity checks:
======================

Paste this in a browser's console for a thrifty/nifty new line encoding/decoding tool:
document.body.innerHTML='<textarea onkeyup="document.body.children[1].innerHTML=event.target.value.replace(/\\n/g,\'\\\\n\')"></textarea><textarea onkeyup="document.body.children[2].innerHTML=event.target.value.replace(/\\\\n/g,\'\\n\')"></textarea><textarea></textarea>';

====

Test that console does not emit anything if disabled?

Test: What if a port is taken? (By some other application.)

Go through the code and see what else needs to be tested that is not directly related to serving files.
 - Reading user files.
   - Static/dynamic.
 - Caching user files.
   - Static/dynamic.

Then, go through the code and start testing content-related stuff:
  - Whether HTML stuff renders.
  - Forms / GET / POST.
  - JSON stuff.
  - File uploads.
    - Temporary upload files should be deleted.
  - Limits exceeded.  Timeouts.
  - Callbacks.
  - waitFor().
  - rtThen() / rtCatch().
  - Other rt's.
  - File operations.
  - Redirects.
  - Cookies.
  - Error 400 / Error 500.
    - Static error 400, static error 500.
    - Other errors.
  - Logging.
  - At this point, resume engine development.

In the end, jscause_backup.conf can be either restored or deleted.

- Leave this file to document future development that needs corresponding testings created.
