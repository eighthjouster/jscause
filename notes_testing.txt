List of sanity checks:
======================

Test the following:
24.
Both console and file:
 - Server general logging: enabled.
 - Server per site logging: enabled.
 - Site logging: enabled.
   - Result:  Console output, SERVER file output, FILE file output.

Test that console does not emit anything if disabled?
 - And files too (serverDir, siteDir).
    jscTestGlobal.logOutputToServerDirOccurred
    jscTestGlobal.logOutputToSiteDirOccurred

(Another test module file? _011.js?)
14.  Test that an actual file is created when file logging:  general, site.

15.  Test that an actual file is DEFINITELY not created when console logging:  general, site.
 - Check the two functions marked with: //__RP TO-DO:  Deal with this function later.

16.  Test that info in an actual file is APPENDED when lfile ogging:  general, site.

17.  Delete the log file and attempt to file log.  It should issue a warning.

18.  Lock the log file (644)  and attempt to file log.  It should issue a warning.

Comment out all the only: true; check that all tests pass.
 - But also check the actual test output, so that it's true that no console/file output means no console/file output


At this point, back up.

===

Test: What if a port is taken? (By some other application.)

Go through the code and see what else needs to be tested that is not directly related to serving files.
 - Reading user files.
   - Static/dynamic.
 - Caching user files.
   - Static/dynamic.

Then, go through the code and start testing content-related stuff:
  - Whether HTML stuff renders.
  - Forms / GET / POST.
  - JSON stuff.
  - File uploads.
    - Temporary upload files should be deleted.
  - Limits exceeded.  Timeouts.
  - Callbacks.
  - waitFor().
  - rtThen() / rtCatch().
  - Other rt's.
  - File operations.
  - Redirects.
  - Cookies.
  - Error 400 / Error 500.
    - Static error 400, static error 500.
    - Other errors.
  - Logging.
  - At this point, resume engine development.

Check all the output when running all the tests, in case there are inconsistencies (e.g., test says no console output, but console output ocurred.  Things like that.)

In the end, jscause_backup.conf can be either restored or deleted.

- Leave this file to document future development that needs corresponding testings created.
