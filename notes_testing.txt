List of sanity checks:
======================

Paste this in a browser's console for a thrifty/nifty new line encoding/decoding tool:
document.body.innerHTML='<textarea onkeyup="document.body.children[1].innerHTML=event.target.value.replace(/\\n/g,\'\\\\n\')"></textarea><textarea onkeyup="document.body.children[2].innerHTML=event.target.value.replace(/\\\\n/g,\'\\n\')"></textarea><textarea></textarea>';

Test: When a mandatory value is missing from site.json (one by one.)
 - Especially the logging section.
 - So, remember that some keys are not mandatory (like the https cert ones.)

Test: Check if a rootDirectoryName value is invalid.
 - As in, it must be a string, not a number.
    - What about other sibling values? "name", for example, can be an integer.  It should complain instead.
    - If not done already.

Test that https cert/key files are valid.
 - This will throw a critical, "unexpected" application error.  Work around this.

- Test that console does not emit anything if disabled?

Test: What if a port is taken? (By some other application.)

Go through the code and see what else needs to be tested that is not directly related to serving files.

Then, go through the code and start testing content-related stuff:
  - Whether HTML stuff renders.
  - Forms / GET / POST.
  - JSON stuff.
  - File uploads.
    - Temporary upload files should be deleted.
  - Limits exceeded.  Timeouts.
  - Callbacks.
  - waitFor().
  - rtThen() / rtCatch().
  - Other rt's.
  - File operations.
  - Redirects.
  - Cookies.
  - Error 400 / Error 500.
    - Static error 400, static error 500.
    - Other errors.
  - Logging.
  - What else?

In the end, jscause_backup.conf can be either restored or deleted.
 - And rename __logs and __sites back to logs/ and sites/
