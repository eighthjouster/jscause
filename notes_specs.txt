JSFramework: working title.

Make JS work as if it was Perl or PHP:

A site/ folder.

With a hierarchy like the followng:

sites/
sites/mysite/
sites/mysite/site_configuration.json
sites/mysite/site_routes.json
sites/mysite/public/
sites/mysite/public/index.html
sites/mysite/public/index.sjs
sites/mysite/files/
sites/mysite/files/user_list.csv
sites/mysite/json/
sites/mysite/json/database.json
sites/mysite/json/custom_config.json
sites/mysite/scripts/
sites/mysite/scripts/main.sjs

public/, json/, files/, site_routes.json and scripts/ must allow hot reloading.
