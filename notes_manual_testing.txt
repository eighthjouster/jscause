========

Please continue with the actual test building:

 - POST requests (in another file.)
   - POST parameters.
     - As forms.
     - As JSON.
     - As some other format (it should throw error 500, I think?)

Put in the test dev docs:
The use of initConsoleLogCapture(), endConsoleLogCapture() and processResponse()

AT THIS POINT: BACK UP.

 - Uploads:
  - Two sites, two separate temp upload directories, right?
 - At this point, release the alpha.

 - Handling PUT/DELETE requests (which I think aren't supported - yet [ever?])
 - Stalling the page with a setTimeout.
 - Callbacks and rt.waitFor(), rt.Then(), rt.Catch() (or whatever their right syntax are.)
   - Nesting.
 - rt.* methods.
 - Other file names.
   - Other extensions.
   - No extensions.
   - Configuration: No using of extensions.
   - Default index.jscp
 - Static files.
 - Static files requested with POST.

At this point, _manually test_ (for real) the rest (uploads, serving error files, etc.)
 - Maybe you can document your steps, for reference when implementing more tests in the future.
   - And then check that entries are already documented elsewhere in the document, and delete duplicates.

Then, refer to notes_testing.txt
