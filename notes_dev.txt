Clear all header entries?

Redirects?

Cookies?

Send JSON?

Other files? (images, css).

Implement: GET and POST.
 - Static pages.
Implement: Submit form data.
 - Ajax.
Implement: Talk to a databse.
Implement:
 - https
 - redirections
 - modules/plugins
   - redistributable packages
 - HTTP authentication?
 - How to avoid that the server dies on error?
   - Or at least it should restart itself.
     - Avoid endless loops?
