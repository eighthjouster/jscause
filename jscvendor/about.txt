This directory contains all the JSCause dependencies.

Therefore, JSCause does not need to get anything else via NPM.

These dependencies, and their dependencies, were retrieved from their respective repositories, untouched.  They are all glued together via the vendor_template.jsctpl file.

For developers: If you plan to add more dependencies here, find options that have zero or one, maybe two MAXIMUM dependencies.  Let's keep JSCause lean.
